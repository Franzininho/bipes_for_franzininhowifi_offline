(these repositories are already cloned for testing purposes)

Some functions of ui/index.html were based on Blopy project (https://github.com/mnoriaki/Blopy), by Noriaki Mitsunaga
 (https://github.com/mnoriaki).
 
 OpenCV blocks were automatically generated using berak's OpenCV to Blockly generator (https://github.com/berak/blockly-cv2/tree/master/gen).
